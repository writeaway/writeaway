            <p>My father's family name being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(Great_Expectations)">Pirrip</a>,
                and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
                than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.</p>
            <p>I give Pirrip as my fatherвЂ™s family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,вЂ”Mrs. Joe
                Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness
                of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding
